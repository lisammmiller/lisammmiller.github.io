I am a Ph.D. student in Germany. My current research project focus is social media research, health communication, and computational communication research. I am also interested in media culture, feminism studies, and gender equality.

I obtained my first master’s degree in International Journalism at HKBU, Hong Kong. I reported issues focus on gender equality and minority groups such as LGBTQ communities. Furthermore, I also worked as an intern host and reporter at Radio Television Hong Kong (RTHK).

Before that, I finished my bachelor’s study in journalism at Shenzhen University. I also worked as an intern journalist at Southern Metropolis Daily.
