I am a PhD Candidate in Germany. My research interests including feminism studies, gender equality, health communication, social media research, media culture, and computational communication research.

I obtained first master’s degree in International Journalism at HKBU, Hong Kong. I reported issues focus on gender equality and minority groups such as LGBTQ communities. I also worked as an intern host and reporter in Radio Television Hong Kong(RTHK).Before that, I finished my bachelor’s study in journalism at Shenzhen University. I also worked as an intern journalist at Southern Metropolis Daily.

I love traveling and experiencing different cultures. I have studied in Taiwan as an exchange student there. And I have been to Thailand, Indonesia, and Europe. I feel appreciated in every journey since I can explore the world and gain new insights.
